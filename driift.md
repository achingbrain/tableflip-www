## DRIIFT

Automated entry, real-time analytics and attendee insights all using the latest NFC + Beacon technologies.

In collaboration with Chris Waring of wwaves, TABLEFLIP took their Meteor knowledge and built a web and NFC based solution for conferences and festivals to gain insight and info on their event, in realtime.

DRIIFT provides all sorts of awesomes that allow attendees to have more fun and make more connections, sponsors to gather more leads and get their name out better, and organisers to get info on how their event went, where people were and what they were doing.

DRIIFT is built as a Meteor web application and a Cordova phone app. It uses the latest NFC technology at it's base. We've been seen at tech events such as [bacon conf](http://devslovebacon.com/), [LXJS](http://2014.lxjs.org/) and [Container Camp](http://container.camp/).
