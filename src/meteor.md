## Meteor

TABLEFLIP and friends organise the monthly Meteor London meetup.

  Meteor have contracted TABLEFLIP on a number of occasions to build various internal as well as external projects. Our most recent collaboration was on the "Meteor Now" campaign website, which aimed to raise $25,000 for [CodeNow](http://codenow.org/) - a nonprofit focused on teaching under-represented youth to code.

  TABLEFLIP recently started running [Meteor training](http://www.meteorlondon.com/) for javascript developers and beginners, aiming to introduce building web apps with Meteor.

  The first training day was a great success, we had around 10 students and also teamed up with [Ladies who Code](http://www.ladieswhocode.com/) to offer a scholorship place.

  In October 2014 Meteor released the long awaited version 1.0 of the framework and with it redesigned their logo and website. TABLEFLIP were pleasantly surprised to find themselves featured on the [Professional Services](https://www.meteor.com/professional-services) page of the site.
