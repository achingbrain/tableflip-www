  Meteor have contracted TABLEFLIP on a number of occasions to build various internal as well as external projects. Our most recent collaboration was on the "Meteor Now" campaign website, which aimed to raise $25,000 for [CodeNow](http://codenow.org/) - a nonprofit focused on teaching under-represented youth to code.

  TABLEFLIP recently started running Meteor training for javascript developers and beginners, aiming to introduce building web apps with Meteor.

  Our first training day was a great success, we had around 10 students and also teamed up with [Ladies of Code](https://www.ladiesofcode.com/) to offer a scholorship place.
