TABLEFLIP moderized the [SVS securities](https://www.svssecurities.com/) site by porting their previous code base from .NET to node.

The site has a fully responsive design and makes use of some interesting programming patterns behind the scenes ([find out more here](http://nodepatternsbooks.com/books/work-queues.html)). TABLEFLIP is proud of the work it has done on this serious, and in places complex, site.
