        h2 Working with us
        p Having worked with many startups and entrepreneurs we have distilled a way of working that really suits creative innovation. Come to us with your idea and talk us through it. We then prepare for you the first workplan that takes the form of a 5 day sprint. At the end of the 5 days you will have something live to visit or download onto your phone, something to test and put in front of your users.
        p The first version will not be the complete expression of your idea, it will be the Minimal Viable Product (MVP) that then becomes the kernel of the next iteration.
        p We review the previous sprint, consider the feedback from your testing, and then define the next sprint with you. This pattern we repeat until you are going live, talking at launch events and sending off press releases about your new product!
        p Sometimes we like to spend a little longer working on your product than just the 5 day sprint, but you don’t pay for these days and we’ll explain what we are doing at the time. If you are using us like an incubator for your product our pricing also has some flexibility built into it.

        p Do you need a website on the internet that is truly yours? TABLEFLIP will build you a simple bespoke website that you can change and update whenever you like.

        p Want to change some wording? - No Problem.
        p What to swap out an image? - You can do that.
