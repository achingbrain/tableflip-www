## KitMapper

TABLEFLIP worked with [KitMapper](https://kitmapper.com/) to design &amp; build a peer-to-peer audiovisual equipment rental service.

  The [KitMapper](https://kitmapper.com/) team came to us with an idea: an app that let people rent out unused audiovisual equipment to people who had a use for it.

  We worked out the details with them and delivered a functional prototype, then we built on that prototype over the next few months until they had a product that was ready for launch.

  The site is a single-page web app designed so that it can be repackaged as a native mobile app. It features map-based search, user verification and a chat system, all built on top of that original prototype - and we're still working with KitMapper to make it even better.
