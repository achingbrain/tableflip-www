[PoleStar Space Applications](http://www.polestarglobal.com/) primarily allow their customers to track and monitor their fleet through various web and mobile applications. TABLEFLIP worked extensively with Polestar on their flagship application Purplefinder.

TABLEFLIP was tasked with re-skining their aging Java applet based web application to give it a new lease of life. We worked closely with the backend team to integrate a new look and feel and port the features of the applet to a new, modern, [LeafletJS](http://leafletjs.com/) based map. We made use of the latest web technologies such as websockets and CSS3 animations whilst also ensuring the application was useable on mobile devices.

TABLEFLIP also built their main website and their newest product to hit the financial market [PurpleTRAC](http://purpletrac.polestarglobal.com).
