## NodeSchool

TABLEFLIP have helped run and mentor at NodeSchool in London since the concept was first devised.

We built the [London chapter site](http://nodeschool.io/london/) and can be regularly seen helping others on the [NodeSchool discussion forums](https://github.com/nodeschool/discussions/).

Our workshop "Nodebot Workshop" is a featured elective on the [NodeSchool website](http://nodeschool.io/).
